This is a standalone mod that adds the ability to upgrade steel blocks to stainless steel, and changes the material property of stainless steel into bedrock, making it indestructible.

It also makes the bedrock material equal to stainless steel in building stability so it will not affect structural integrity.

To remove a stainless steel block, you can upgrade it using 10 grass fibers and any upgrading tool into a frame block.
